# Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project(USING PYTHON) 🍕
This project analyzes transactional pizza sales data to uncover business insights that support decision-making in sales, operations, and inventory management. The analysis simulates a real-world business intelligence engagement using a structured Business Requirements Document (BRD) and an end-to-end analytics workflow.
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to transform raw pizza sales data into actionable insights that help management:
- Understand revenue and demand trends
- Identify top-performing and underperforming products
- Optimize staffing, inventory, and promotional strategies
- Monitor key performance indicators through visual dashboards
## Business Questions Answered
- What is the total revenue, total orders, and total pizzas sold?
- Which pizza categories, sizes, and individual products generate the most revenue?
- Which pizzas are the best-selling and least-selling by quantity and revenue?
- What are the daily, hourly, and monthly sales trends?
- When do peak demand periods occur?
- How does Average Order Value (AOV) vary by day and time?
- Which products should be promoted, optimized, or reconsidered?
- How can staffing and inventory planning be aligned with demand patterns?
## Dataset Description
The Data Set was downloaded from Kaggle .
This project was developed using a formal Business Requirements Document (BRD) to simulate a real-world analytics engagement.”

## Key Fields:
- order_id: Unique identifier for each order
- pizza_name: Name of pizza sold
- pizza_category: Category classification (Classic, Veggie, Chicken, Supreme)
- pizza_size: Size of pizza (S, M, L, XL)
- quantity: Number of pizzas sold
- total_price: Revenue per transaction
- order_date & order_time: Timestamp fields for time-based analysis
## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and transformation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Google Colab for cloud-based analysis
- Microsoft Excel (dashboard alignment)
- GitHub for version control and portfolio hosting
## Key KPIs
- Total Revenue
- Total Orders
- Total Pizzas Sold
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Average Pizzas per Order
- Revenue by Category and Size
- Top 5 & Bottom 5 Products
## Dashboard Visualizations
- KPI cards for revenue, orders, AOV, and pizzas sold
- Daily sales trend by day of week
- Hourly sales trend and demand heatmap
- Monthly revenue trend analysis
- Revenue and quantity by pizza category
- Revenue and quantity by pizza size
- Top 5 and Bottom 5 pizzas by performance
- Average Order Value by day of week
## Key Insights
Large-sized pizzas contribute the highest share of total revenue. Sales peak during specific hours and weekends, indicating clear demand cycles. A small number of pizza products drive a large portion of total revenue. Certain low-performing pizzas consistently underperform and may require redesign or removal.
## Business Recommendations
- Focus marketing campaigns on high-performing pizza categories and sizes.
- Optimize staffing levels during identified peak sales hours.
- Adjust inventory planning based on category and size demand patterns.
- Bundle or promote slow-moving pizzas with top sellers.
- Continuously monitor KPIs using dashboards for proactive decision-making.
